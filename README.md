This repository contains the implementation of the paper:

**Capturing forceful interaction with arbitrary objects using a deep learning-powered stretchable tactile array**

It contains two parts
- **ViTaM_Algorithm**: the training code for the ViTaM model
- **rfhand-serial-broker-final**: VR Interface for the glove using RFUniverse
