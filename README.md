# Capturing forceful interaction with deformable objects using a deep learning-powered stretchable tactile array
This repository contains the implementation of the paper:

**Capturing forceful interaction with arbitrary objects using a deep learning-powered stretchable tactile array**

It contains two parts
- **ViTaM_Algorithm**: the training code for the ViTaM model, please refer to [README](https://github.com/jeffsonyu/ViTaM/blob/main/ViTaM_Algorithm/README.md) of the training code for more details.
- **rfhand-serial-broker-final**: VR Interface for the glove using RFUniverse, please refer to [README](https://github.com/jeffsonyu/ViTaM/blob/main/rfhand-serial-broker-final/README.md) of the VR Interface for more details.
